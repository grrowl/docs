description: 'Sync your machines from GitHub with Stately Studio.'
---

You can connect a GitHub repo to a new project in Stately Studio, keeping updates between GitHub and Stately Studio in sync. Connecting a GitHub repo allows you to import your existing machines from GitHub and push changes to your machines back to your repo as pull requests.

Connect GitHub repo is a premium feature of Stately Studio. You can try Stately Studio’s premium plans with a free trial. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](studio-pro-plan.mdx), [Team plan](studio-team-plan.mdx), [Enterprise plan](studio-enterprise-plan.mdx) or [upgrade your existing plan](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

## Connect GitHub repo

There are three steps to setting up your GitHub repo as a connected project:

1. Select the repo. You can choose the repos based on your GitHub permissions.
2. Select the branch. You can choose any branch in your repo.
3. Choose the files you want to sync. You can sync any JavaScript or TypeScript files, but only XState machines will be imported.

:::tip

Enabling **auto-sync** will automatically fetch the latest changes from your connected repository every time you open the project in the Studio.

Disable auto-sync from the GitHub options found by clicking the repository name in the footer of the left drawer.

:::

When a project is synced to GitHub:

- A GitHub <Github size={18}/> icon is displayed alongside the GitHub repo and branch names in the footer of the editor’s left drawer.
- A GitHub <Github size={18}/> icon is displayed in the project information in the Projects list.

### Create pull requests

Open the GitHub options by clicking the repository name in the footer of the left drawer. You can create pull requests from the GitHub options for any changes made to your machine.

### Sync multiple branches

You can sync multiple branches in your GitHub repo to the same project in Stately Studio. Open the GitHub branch options from the branch name in the footer of the left drawer to choose additional branches.

## GitHub permissions

Importing your GitHub repos with **Connect GitHub repo** or importing a machine with a GitHub URL will prompt you to give our GitHub integration access to your GitHub repositories. You can choose from **Automatic setup** or **Personal access token**.

### Automatic setup

Automatic setup will enable access to all the repositories your GitHub user can access. You can [provide your own personal access token](#personal-access-token) if you need more granular control.

### Personal access token

For more granular control, you can provide a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). You can create a personal access token in your GitHub account settings under [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

To ensure GitHub Sync works correctly, you must grant the following permissions to your personal access token:

- **Contents**: Allow **Read** access so Stately Studio can import your machines.
- **Pull requests**: Allow **Read and write** access so Stately Studio can create pull requests for you (optional).

You can update your personal access token from your user <Settings size={18}/> **Settings** in Stately Studio anytime.

## Import machine from a GitHub URL

If you want to quickly import a machine, or multiple machines, from a GitHub file without syncing, you can import from a GitHub URL.

1. Open a file containing one or more machines on GitHub.
2. Modify the URL in the browser’s address bar to replace the `.com` with `.stately.ai`.
3. The editor will then display your imported machine.
4. **Save** the machine to enable editing and easily find your machine in your projects later.

Importing from a GitHub URL works with files in any branch in your private repositories, any public repositories, and any files in pull requests.

### Example

When your machine is hosted at GitHub:
`https://github.com/username/repo/blob/main/apps/superMachine.ts`, update the URL to
`https://github.stately.ai/username/repo/blob/main/apps/superMachine.ts` and Stately Studio will start the import.
